This repo stores my current and past resumes, cover letters, headliners, etc., used for different fields.

I have resumes stored on several online platforms. The following list indicates which have been updated most recently (as of 12/27/2019). (This helps me identify the best source to use when updating my resume.)

1. [Indeed](https://my.indeed.com/p/anthonye-f0x91nh)
2. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-elhabr/)
3. [Personal website](tonyelhabr.rbind.io)
