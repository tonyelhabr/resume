This repo stores my current and past resumes, cover letters, headliners, etc., used for different fields.

I have resumes stored on several online platforms. The following list indicates which have been updated most recently (as of `r format(Sys.Date(), '%m/%d/%Y')`). (This helps me identify the best source to use when updating my resume.)
