In a nutshell, I would call myself an "aspiring data scientist". I currently work as a power systems engineer in the Grid Analysis group (Operations Planning department) at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)---the independent system operator of the Texas electric grid. I realize that, on the surface, this job title (and the titles of my past positions at ERCOT) does not necessarily imply that I may have much familiarity with data processing and analysis. In fact, this is not true.

Although every day of work is different for me, most often I'm writing SQL or SAS to pull data, writing scripts to process the data (usually with R, but sometimes with python or VBA), and creating plots (again, usually with R). My efforts go towards helping my group improve its understanding of real-time events---e.g. transmission faults, generations trips, price spikes. As one might imagine, my day-to-day work has necessitated that I have strong skills in data processing and analysis.

Outside of work, my biggest passion has always been sports. I have actively watched and read about the NBA (along with some college and international basketball) and the NFL (along with some college football) for as long as I can remember. More recently, I've started following the EPL and Champions League. I still play some sports---softball and soccer with work groups, and hoops a couple of times a year---but, admittedly, I was never all that athletic. (To my credit, at least I am "coordinated" in most things, which comes in handy when playing a random game of ping pong or a round of Top Golf.) Outside of these things, I follow the news in sports betting markets, and I enjoy playing fantasy sports.

And, speaking of odds sports and fantasy, since 2012, I've maintained a "database"---really, a couple of spreadsheets and an sqlite database---of game and season-long predictions that me and my two brothers make for the NFL and the NBA. Of course, I've developed code to help me maintain this database. Most notably, I've created scripts to scrape schedules, scores, and odds. I'm not completely sure what I'll end up doing with all of this self-maintained data---perhaps an analysis of personal biases---but I think this kind of personal project is fun and is a great way to keep myself active with data analysis. (Anyways, I hope it's clear that I have a passion for sports and data analysis.)

As a life-long sports fan, the opportunity to apply the skills that I've developed to help a sports team achieve success would be a dream come true. I've never completely felt "right" as a power systems engineer. (Even though there are plenty of times where I "get" to use my data skills in my current job, there are also plenty of times where I must do more traditional power systems analysis using industry-specific software. The former is what I really enjoy, and the latter is less enjoyable, although necessary, of course.)

Over the past three years (since the last semester of my undergraduate education), I've come to believe that my ideal career is as a data scientist. To this end, since the summer of 2018 I've been working towards an analytics degree through the Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA) program offered by Georgia Tech. Given my work experience with data processing and prior knowledge of machine learning, I've been able to go through the program quickly, taking two classes per semester alongside my full-time job. (Even though it's not uncommon for students to take two classes per semester in this program, it's a bit uncommon to do it every semester.) Most importantly for me, the classes I've taken have solidified my belief that my future lies in data analysis.

What kind of data scientist role would I be best in? To be honest, I think I could excel in several different roles---data engineer with a focus on databases or cloud services, data analyst with a focus on visualization, or machine learning engineer with a focus on putting models in production---given the chance to prove myself.

To speak on one of the many aspects of data science, let me discuss the appeal of data visualization to me. In the past three years or so, telling stories through visualization has really become an interest to me. I'm on reddit's r/dataisbeautiful forum almost every day, and I've been actively engaging in the online #rstats community. (R is my programming language of choice.) To me, visualization is a wonderful form of expression. It is not only awesome just in the abstract, but also because of the change that it can set forth. It has the power to facilitate meaningful insight that can lead to actionable outcomes. (Of course, one must be careful not to mislead an audience with a ill-formed visualization.) I think this power of visualization is what draws me to it, and is why I'd love to be able to spend more of my time creating visualizations than my current work calls for.

But visualization is just one aspect of data science, and just one aspect that I feel that I excel at. Processing data and automating tasks with scripts are other tasks with which I am very familiar. In all, I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that I can have an impact in a variety of responsibilities associated with data science.
