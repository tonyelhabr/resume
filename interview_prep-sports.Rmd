+ Definition (brief):
  + "Expected goals is a method for estimating the quality of chances that a football team creates or concedes in a match. This is the thing I like a lot about xG. It may take a lot of data crunching to create specific xG values, but the underlying idea makes football sense. How many good chances did a team create?"
  
+ Inputs (brief):
  + distance (to goal)
  + angle (to goal)
  + type of pass
    + cross
    + throughball
    + etc.
  + type of play leading to shot
    + set play
    + counterattack
    + establish possession
    + etc.

+ Formula for "Regular Shots"
  + log(`goals`) = 
  (
  -3.19 
  - 0.095 * `distance` 
  + 3.18 * `inverse_distance` 
  + 1.88 * `relative_angle` 
  + 0.24 * `inverse_angle` 
  - 2.09 * `inverse_dist*angle` 
  + 0.45 * throughball_assist 
  + 0.64 * throughball_2nd_assist
  + 0.31 * assist_across_face 
  - 0.15 * cutback_assist 
  + 2.18 * inverse_assist_distance 
  + 0.12 * assist_angle 
  + 0.23 * fast_break 
  + 0.18 * counterattack 
  + 0.09 * established_possession 
  - 0.18 * following_corner 
  + 1.2 * big_chance 
  + 1.1 * following_error 
  + 0.39 * following_dribble 
  + 0.14 * dribble_distance 
  + 0.37 * rebound 
  + 0.03 * game_state 
  + 0.07 * Bundesliga 
  - 0.1 * EPL 
  - 0.09 * LaLiga 
  - 0.07 * SerieA
  )
  
+ There are additional formulas for
  + headed shots assisted by crosses
  + non-headed shots assisted by crosses
  + headed shots not assisted by crosses
  + shots from direct free kicks
  + shots following a dribble of the keeper
  
+ Evaluation:
  + Used 2010-20111 through 2013-2014 data ffor big five leagues for training data.
  + Used 2014-2105 data from big five leagues for testing data.
  + RMSE of 0.258 on in-sample data and out-of sample data.
  + R^2 for Ligue 1 was notably lower compared to the other leagues.

+ Inputs:
  + distance (to goal)
  + big_chance
    + "A situation where a player should reasonable be expected to score usually in a one-on-one scenario or from very close range."
  + directness
  + assist_dist
  + dribble
  + rebound
  + assist_angle
  + counterattack
  + error
  + throughball
  + angle (to goal)
  
+ Inuition:
  + Provides an estimate the quality of the scoring opportunity
  + "What is the likelihood that a shot from this location and in this game situtation will be scored?"
    + location + situtation = xG
